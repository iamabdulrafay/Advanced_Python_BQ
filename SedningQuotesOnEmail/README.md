This repository contains a Python project aimed at automating the task of sending motivational quotes via email every Monday. It's a practical exercise based on what I've learned in my advanced Python course, focusing on email automation.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Automatically send motivational quotes to a specified email address every Monday.
- Utilize Python's capabilities for email handling and automation.
- Implement scheduling to ensure quotes are sent reliably each week.
