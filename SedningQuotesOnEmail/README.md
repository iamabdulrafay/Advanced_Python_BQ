# Motivational Quotes Email Automation Task

This repository contains a Python project aimed at automating the task of sending motivational quotes via email every Monday. It's a practical exercise based on what I've learned in my advanced Python course, focusing on email automation.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Automatically send motivational quotes to a specified email address every Monday.
- Utilize Python's capabilities for email handling and automation.
- Implement scheduling to ensure quotes are sent reliably each week.

## Acknowledgment

Special thanks to my mentor, Muzamil Bilwani, for teaching us valuable skills and guiding us through challenging concepts. This project wouldn't have been possible without his support and expertise.

## Project Structure

- **main.py**: Python script for generating and sending emails with motivational quotes.
- **quotes.txt**: Text file containing a collection of motivational quotes.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
